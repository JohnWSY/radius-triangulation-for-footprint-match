# radius-triangulation-for-footprint-match
a method to judge whether two footprints are same source or not

1.json2csv is based on a algorithm which label the feature, and the result csv give us the coordinate and direction of feature also type of feature.

2.after calculating all the elements of radius triangulation, we get two distribution, one is from same source, the other is different source

3.the algorithm is not finished yet, next we will calc LR with two distribution
